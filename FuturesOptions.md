Dates vary because every commodity market is different. Grain contract expirations are based on planting and harvesting cycles. Grain options expire at the end of the month before the futures. Crude oil contracts expire every month, and the options expire three days before the futures. Bond options are the weirdest of all. They expire on the last Friday that precedes the last business day of the month preceding the option month, by at least two business days.
